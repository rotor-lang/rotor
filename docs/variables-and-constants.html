            <h1>Understanding variables and constants</h1>

            <p>
                Since that we've created our first Rotor project, let's dive into all the juicy parts of programming and how to use the Rotor toolchain.
                In this document, we’ll cover the basics of variables and constants.
                These are super important in programming — you’ll be using them all the time. So let’s jump in!
            </p>

            <h2>Variables</h2>
            <p>
                If you’ve done any programming before, you probably already know what a variable is.
                A variable, in the simplest terms, is a thing that stores stuff.
                That’s a super broad definition, but honestly, it's accurate most of the time.
                For example, if I wanted to store my age, I could make a variable called <code>age</code> and assign it a value.
                In Rotor, that would look like:
                <code>let age = 18;</code>
                So what’s happening here? We're creating a variable called <code>age</code> and assigning it the value <code>18</code>.
                Most modern languages work the same way.
                The keyword <code>let</code> just tells Rotor “Hey, I’m making a variable here,” and gives it a value to start with.
            </p>

            <h2>Constants</h2>
            <p>
                Constants are like variables, but with one big difference: once you set them, you can’t change them.
                You might ask, “Why use a constant when I can just use a variable?” That’s a great question, and a lot of beginners ask the same thing.
            </p>
            <div class="tip">
                <img src="assets/hint.png" alt="Hint" />
                <span>
                    <strong>Tip:</strong> This part will be a bit more technical, but don't worry if it feels a bit confusing at first. This will make more sense as you get deeper into programming.
                </span>
            </div>
            <p>
                Basically, when you know something won’t ever change, using a constant helps make your code more predictable.
                It also lets the compiler do smart optimizations.
                For example, in a low-level language like C, you could write something like:
            </p>
            <pre><code>#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
int main() {
    uint8_t *ptr = (uint8_t *)0x12345678;
    *ptr = 18;
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
            <p>
                That’s a direct memory write — kinda wild, right? It’s risky, unreadable, and error-prone. 
                Using variables and constants helps avoid all that mess. The compiler figures out the best way to store your values, 
                and you get to write readable code.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, back to constants — if you know a value won’t change, like the value of pi, use a constant. 
                In Rotor, you’d do it like this:
                <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
                That tells the compiler “Yo, this value is locked in forever,” and it can optimize your code with that in mind.
                (And let’s be real — pi’s not changing anytime soon.)
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Variables can *feel* tricky at first, but don’t stress — we’re just getting started.
                Once you get the hang of assigning values and knowing when to use a variable vs a constant, you're good.
                Later on, we’ll get into more advanced stuff like pointers, references, and all the juicy low-level magic.
                But for now, just remember: a variable is a name for a value you might change, and a constant is one that stays the same.
                That’s it. You got this.
